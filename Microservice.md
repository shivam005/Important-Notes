### Dora (DevOps Research and Assessment) Metrics:
It is meant to assess the devops best practices, It is analyzed based on below mentioned points:
 1. Frequency of deployments 
 2. The amount of time between acceptance and deployment 
 3. How frequently deployments fail 
 4. How long it takes to restore service—or recover from a failure

Every architecture can also be tested based upon the outcome of dora metrics.

How do you handle communication between microservices?
Scenario: Two microservices need to communicate with each other to complete a business transaction. How would you handle this communication in Java?

What is service discovery, and how can you implement it in Java?
Scenario: You are building a microservices-based application, and you need to implement service discovery. How would you do this in Java?

How do you handle failures and retries in microservices?
Scenario: A microservice fails to complete a task. How would you handle this failure in Java, and how would you ensure that the task is retried?

How do you implement security in microservices?
Scenario: You are developing a microservice that needs to access sensitive data. How would you ensure that the microservice is secure, and what security protocols would you use in Java?

How do you handle versioning in microservices?
Scenario: You need to make changes to a microservice, but you don't want to break the existing APIs that other microservices are using. How would you handle versioning in Java?

How do you implement load balancing in microservices?
Scenario: You have multiple instances of a microservice running, and you need to distribute the traffic evenly between them. How would you implement load balancing in Java?

How do you ensure data consistency between microservices?
Scenario: Two microservices need to access the same data, and you need to ensure that the data remains consistent. How would you handle this in Java?

How do you handle asynchronous communication between microservices?
Scenario: One microservice needs to send a message to another microservice asynchronously. How would you handle this in Java, and what protocols would you use?

How do you handle scaling and deployment of microservices?
Scenario: You have to deploy a new microservice, and you need to ensure that it can scale easily. How would you handle scaling and deployment in Java?
