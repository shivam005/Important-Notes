# DataIntenesiveApplication-Notes

There are two types of application:
## Data Intensive (Data is the challenge)  & Compute Intensive (Computational power is the challenge)
There are very slight difference in the message queue and DB. There are datastores that are also used as message queues (Redis), and there are message queues with database-like durability guar‐
antees (Apache Kafka).
