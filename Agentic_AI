### To transform agentic AI from hype to reality, AWS has identified four key enablers:

1. Advanced model reasoning capabilities provide smarter, more cost-effective foundation models.

2. Robust data and knowledge integration grounds agents in enterprise context and proprietary data.

3. Scalable infrastructure and AI agent communication protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol to ensure secure agent operation and connectivity.

4. Sophisticated agent development and orchestration tools enable the design, deployment, and management of agents at scale.

#### The key difference? We're moving from AI that assists with specific tasks: Analyze → Summarize
#### to AI that autonomously manages entire processes: Analyze → Recommend → Plan → Execute → Monitor → Adapt

#### While generative AI excels at creating content and providing insights, agentic AI takes this further by understanding objectives, planning actions, and executing decisions over time. This represents a fundamental shift from assistance to autonomy - from tools that help us think to agents that help us do.
AI is......
Responsive: AI performs a single task
Suggestive: AI is human-directed, provides suggestions
Proactive: AI automatically monitors
Autonomous: Agentic AI learns and adapts
