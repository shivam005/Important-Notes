## What is agentic AI?
#### It is an

|Open-Source LLMs Model|LLaMA (Meta), Falcon, Mistral, BLOOM|

### To transform agentic AI from hype to reality, AWS has identified four key enablers:

1. Advanced model reasoning capabilities provide smarter, more cost-effective foundation models.

2. Robust data and knowledge integration grounds agents in enterprise context and proprietary data.

3. Scalable infrastructure and AI agent communication protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol to ensure secure agent operation and connectivity.

4. Sophisticated agent development and orchestration tools enable the design, deployment, and management of agents at scale.

### Strands Agents
Need to study

#### The key difference? We're moving from AI that assists with specific tasks: Analyze → Summarize
#### to AI that autonomously manages entire processes: Analyze → Recommend → Plan → Execute → Monitor → Adapt

#### While generative AI excels at creating content and providing insights, agentic AI takes this further by understanding objectives, planning actions, and executing decisions over time. This represents a fundamental shift from assistance to autonomy - from tools that help us think to agents that help us do.
AI is......
Responsive: AI performs a single task
Suggestive: AI is human-directed, provides suggestions
Proactive: AI automatically monitors
Autonomous: Agentic AI learns and adapts


#### There are some issues with the AI agents like 
## Agent Hallucination 
which can be managed using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and AgentCore.
## Agent Co-ordination Failure
Consensus Protocols (agents must 'check in' with each other), Conflict Resolution (Assigning different priority level), State Management (By maintaining'single source of truth').
AWS has AgentCore's coordination services, helping agents work together smoothly.

#### Further for an agent to avoid costly mistake, we can set confidence scoring, Establishing some threshold (Like only refund upto 500 Rs.), Configiring rollbacks. 

#### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Standardized AI integration: Your tools become instantly compatible with any MCP-enabled AI system
Reduced integration costs: No custom connectors for each AI platform
Ecosystem participation: Join a broader network of interoperable tools
Competitive advantage: Early adopters gain distribution through AI marketplaces

#### A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)
Automated partnerships: AI agents negotiate and execute business processes autonomously
Dynamic supply chains: Real-time optimization without human intervention
New revenue models: Usage-based pricing, micro-transactions between agents
Operational efficiency: 24/7 automated business operations
