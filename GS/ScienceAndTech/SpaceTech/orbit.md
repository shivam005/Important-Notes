A satellite orbit refers to the curved path a satellite follows around a celestial body, such as Earth, the Moon, or another planet. Orbits are determined by a balance between the satellite’s velocity and the gravitational pull of the body it is orbiting. Here’s an overview of satellite orbits and their types:

#### Key Parameters of an Orbit
	1.	Altitude: Height above the surface of the Earth.
	2.	Inclination: Angle between the orbital plane and the equator.
	3.	Eccentricity: Determines the shape of the orbit (circular or elliptical).
	4.	Period: Time it takes for one complete revolution.
	5.	Velocity: Speed needed to maintain the orbit.

#### Types of Satellite Orbits
	1.	Low Earth Orbit (LEO):
	•	Altitude: 160–2,000 km above Earth.
	•	Uses: Earth observation, remote sensing, communication (e.g., Starlink), and the International Space Station.
	•	Characteristics: Short orbital period (90–120 minutes).
	2.	Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):
	•	Altitude: 2,000–35,786 km.
	•	Uses: GPS and navigation satellites.
	•	Characteristics: Moderate orbital period (about 6–12 hours).
	3.	Geostationary Orbit (GEO):
	•	Altitude: ~35,786 km.
	•	Uses: Weather satellites, TV broadcasting, and communication.
	•	Characteristics: Appears stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth because its orbital period matches Earth’s rotation.
	4.	Polar Orbit:
	•	Inclination: Near 90° (passes over the poles).
	•	Uses: Global mapping and Earth observation.
	•	Characteristics: Covers the entire Earth as it rotates underneath.
	5.	Sun-Synchronous Orbit:
	•	Altitude: 600–800 km.
	•	Uses: Earth observation and remote sensing.
	•	Characteristics: Passes over the same region at the same local solar time daily. It helps us in collecting the images in same light and shadow which can be compared over long time range. 
	6.	Elliptical Orbit:
	•	Shape: Highly elliptical rather than circular.
	•	Uses: Specialized missions, such as Molniya orbits for high-latitude communications.
	•	Characteristics: Varying altitude with a long dwell time over certain areas.

#### Specialized Orbits
	•	Transfer Orbits: Used to move satellites between orbits, e.g., Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).
	•	Halo Orbits: Around Lagrange points for certain space telescopes and missions.

#### Forces Acting on a Satellite
	1.	Gravitational Pull: Keeps the satellite in orbit.
	2.	Centripetal Force: Balances gravity to maintain the orbital path.
	3.	Atmospheric Drag: Significant in LEO; requires periodic boosts.
