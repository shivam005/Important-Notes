what do you ask yourself when you read something??

A satellite orbit refers to the curved path a satellite follows around a celestial body, such as Earth, the Moon, or another planet. Orbits are determined by a balance between the satellite’s velocity and the gravitational pull of the body it is orbiting. Here’s an overview of satellite orbits and their types:

#### Key Parameters of an Orbit
	1.	Altitude: Height above the surface of the Earth.
	2.	Inclination: Angle between the orbital plane and the equator.
	3.	Eccentricity: Determines the shape of the orbit (circular or elliptical).
	4.	Period: Time it takes for one complete revolution.
	5.	Velocity: Speed needed to maintain the orbit.

#### Types of Satellite Orbits
	1.	Low Earth Orbit (LEO):
	•	Altitude: 160–2,000 km above Earth.
	•	Uses: Earth observation, remote sensing, communication (e.g., Starlink), and the International Space Station.
	•	Characteristics: Short orbital period (90–120 minutes).
	2.	Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):
	•	Altitude: 2,000–35,786 km.
	•	Uses: GPS and navigation satellites.
	•	Characteristics: Moderate orbital period (about 6–12 hours).
	3.	Geostationary Orbit (GEO):
	•	Altitude: ~35,786 km.
	•	Uses: Weather satellites, TV broadcasting, and communication.
	•	Characteristics: Appears stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth because its orbital period matches Earth’s rotation.
	4.	Polar Orbit:
	•	Inclination: Near 90° (passes over the poles).
	•	Uses: Global mapping and Earth observation.
	•	Characteristics: Covers the entire Earth as it rotates underneath.
	5.	Sun-Synchronous Orbit:
	•	Altitude: 600–800 km.
	•	Uses: Earth observation and remote sensing.
	•	Characteristics: Passes over the same region at the same local solar time daily. It helps us in collecting the images in same light and shadow which can be compared over long time range. 
Usually it is also called as polar sun synchronous satellite because it moves at 90 degree inclination which will let it cover all points on earth and sun remains exactly above it.
The shape of Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. This oblateness causes gravitational perturbations, which lead to the precession of satellite orbits—small shifts in the satellite’s orbital plane over time.

In most cases, this precessional motion is undesirable as it causes deviations from the satellite’s intended position. However, in the case of sun-synchronous satellites, this precession becomes beneficial. Sun-synchronous satellites are designed to maintain a consistent angle with respect to the Sun, enabling them to pass over the same part of the Earth at the same local solar time every day.

This is achieved by taking advantage of Earth’s gravitational bulge, which causes a predictable precession in the satellite’s orbital plane. By carefully designing the satellite’s orbit, this precession can be synchronized with Earth’s annual revolution around the Sun (approximately 365 days or 360 degrees). Thus, the satellite’s orbital plane precesses at a rate of approximately 1 degree per day, aligning itself with the Sun’s position as Earth revolves.

This mechanism ensures that the satellite remains sun-synchronous, providing consistent lighting conditions for imaging or observation, which is critical for applications like weather monitoring, environmental studies, and resource mapping.

	6.	Elliptical Orbit:
	•	Shape: Highly elliptical rather than circular.
	•	Uses: Specialized missions, such as Molniya orbits for high-latitude communications.
	•	Characteristics: Varying altitude with a long dwell time over certain areas.

#### Specialized Orbits
	•	Transfer Orbits: Used to move satellites between orbits, e.g., Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).
	•	Halo Orbits: Around Lagrange points for certain space telescopes and missions.

#### Forces Acting on a Satellite
	1.	Gravitational Pull: Keeps the satellite in orbit.
	2.	Centripetal Force: Balances gravity to maintain the orbital path.
	3.	Atmospheric Drag: Significant in LEO; requires periodic Satellites have revolutionized various sectors and played a crucial role in social upliftment, especially in areas like communication, education, disaster management, healthcare, and agriculture.

### Satellite Techniques
Satellites use a variety of advanced techniques to measure the physical and chemical properties of Earth’s surface, atmosphere, or celestial bodies. These techniques leverage the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light, radar, etc.) with matter to gather precise data. Here are the key methods:

## Navigational satellite
These satellite is used to find the exact location of some point on earth, Navic is the indian navigational satellite.
It requires atleast 4 navigational satellite to determine the exact point on earth because we need to have lattitude, longitude,altitude of the destination and origin point and the fourth satellite is used to correct clock error.

#### Why Clock Errors Matter
	1.	Distance Calculation: Navigation systems use the time it takes for a signal to travel from a satellite to a receiver to calculate distance.

Distance = Speed of Light X Travel Time

If the receiver’s clock is slightly off, the travel time (and thus the calculated distance) will be incorrect.

	2.	Positioning Errors: Even a small clock error (e.g., 1 microsecond) can result in a position error of hundreds of meters because signals travel at the speed of light (~300,000 km/s).
