1. Polar orbits are more useful for earth observation as earth is rotating below it hence all areas of earth can be monitored.
polar satellite are more difficult to be sent as get no benefit from earth rotation (2pir/t) as r is less.
There is a UN body as International telcommunication union to regulate the placement of satellite in geostationary orbit.


Satellites use a variety of advanced techniques to measure the physical and chemical properties of Earth’s surface, atmosphere, or celestial bodies. These techniques leverage the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light, radar, etc.) with matter to gather precise data. Here are the key methods:

1. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
	•	Principle: Uses radar waves to create high-resolution images of surfaces. Unlike optical sensors, SAR can penetrate clouds and operate in all weather conditions, day or night.
	•	How it Works:
	•	Radar pulses are sent toward the target and the reflected signals are measured.
	•	A synthetic aperture is created by combining data from the satellite’s motion.
	•	Applications:
	•	Mapping terrain and land deformation.
	•	Monitoring deforestation, urban growth, and glacier movements.
	•	Disaster management (e.g., detecting landslides and earthquakes).

2. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)
	•	Principle: Uses laser pulses to measure distances and construct 3D models.
	•	How it Works:
	•	A laser beam is emitted, and the time it takes to reflect back is used to calculate distance.
	•	By analyzing multiple returns, physical features like vegetation canopy, terrain, and building heights are mapped.
	•	Applications:
	•	Measuring forest canopy structure and terrain elevation.
	•	Mapping flood zones and disaster-prone areas.
	•	Atmospheric studies (e.g., aerosol and cloud profiling).

3. Spectroscopy
	•	Principle: Analyzes the interaction of light with matter to determine chemical composition.
	•	How it Works:
	•	A spectrometer measures the absorption, emission, or scattering of light at different wavelengths.
	•	Different materials have unique spectral signatures (e.g., water absorbs in the infrared range).
	•	Types:
	•	UV-Vis Spectroscopy: For atmospheric studies (ozone, nitrogen dioxide).
	•	Infrared Spectroscopy: For detecting greenhouse gases like CO₂ and methane.
	•	Raman Spectroscopy: For identifying specific molecular compositions.
	•	Applications:
	•	Atmospheric gas composition and pollution monitoring.
	•	Mineral exploration.
	•	Water quality analysis.

4. Hyperspectral Imaging
	•	Principle: Captures detailed spectral data across hundreds of narrow wavelength bands for each pixel in an image.
	•	How it Works:
	•	A hyperspectral sensor collects data in multiple contiguous spectral bands, providing a “spectral fingerprint” for materials.
	•	Applications:
	•	Agriculture: Crop health and soil analysis.
	•	Environmental monitoring: Pollution detection and land cover classification.
	•	Mineralogy: Identifying mineral compositions.

5. Multispectral Imaging
	•	Principle: Similar to hyperspectral imaging but captures fewer spectral bands (e.g., visible, infrared, and thermal).
	•	How it Works:
	•	Measures reflected or emitted light in specific wavelength ranges.
	•	Applications:
	•	Satellite imaging for vegetation health, land use mapping, and ocean monitoring.
	•	Thermal imaging for urban heat islands and forest fire detection.

6. Infrared and Thermal Imaging
	•	Principle: Detects infrared radiation emitted by objects based on their temperature.
	•	How it Works:
	•	Sensors measure emitted thermal energy to determine temperature and material properties.
	•	Applications:
	•	Monitoring volcanic activity and forest fires.
	•	Urban planning and heat loss detection.
	•	Measuring sea surface and atmospheric temperatures.

7. Gravimetry
	•	Principle: Measures variations in Earth’s gravitational field to infer mass distribution.
	•	How it Works:
	•	Satellites like GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) measure subtle changes in gravity caused by water, ice, or tectonic movement.
	•	Applications:
	•	Monitoring groundwater depletion and ice mass loss.
	•	Understanding tectonic activity.

8. Magnetometry
	•	Principle: Measures magnetic field strength to study Earth’s magnetosphere and subsurface structures.
	•	How it Works:
	•	Sensors detect changes in magnetic field intensity.
	•	Applications:
	•	Mapping geological structures.
	•	Studying Earth’s magnetic field variations.

9. Radiometry
	•	Principle: Measures natural electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects.
	•	How it Works:
	•	Sensors capture radiation in different wavelengths (e.g., microwave, infrared).
	•	Applications:
	•	Ocean salinity and soil moisture monitoring.
	•	Measuring sea surface temperatures.
	•	Atmospheric profiling.

10. Altimetry
	•	Principle: Measures the height of a satellite above the Earth’s surface.
	•	How it Works:
	•	A radar or laser altimeter emits pulses and measures the time taken for the return signal.
	•	Applications:
	•	Sea level rise monitoring.
	•	Mapping ocean currents and surface waves.
	•	Glacial and ice sheet thickness measurements.

11. Polarimetry
	•	Principle: Analyzes the polarization of reflected or emitted light to determine physical properties.
	•	Applications:
	•	Atmospheric studies (e.g., aerosol and cloud properties).
	•	Surface roughness detection (e.g., soil and water bodies).

Role in Satellite Applications
	•	Physical Properties:
	•	Terrain elevation (LiDAR, SAR, Altimetry).
	•	Surface roughness (Polarimetry, SAR).
	•	Temperature and heat distribution (Thermal Imaging).
	•	Chemical Properties:
	•	Atmospheric gases (Spectroscopy).
	•	Water quality and composition (Hyperspectral Imaging).
	•	Mineral detection (Spectroscopy, Hyperspectral Imaging).

These techniques, used individually or in combination, allow satellites to perform precise measurements, contributing to advancements in Earth observation, environmental monitoring, disaster management, and resource exploration.
