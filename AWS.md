# AWS-Notes

| Keywords | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
|Amazon EC2 + ELB | Traditional Approach (Virtual Servers + Load Balancing)|
|AWS Elastic Beanstalk |Simplify management of web apps and simple batch apps. Automatically
creates EC2 + ELB (load balancing and auto scaling) |
|AWS Elastic Container
Service (ECS) |Simplify running of microservices with Docker containers. Run containers in
EC2 based ECS Clusters. |
| Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)|Run Managed Kubernetes Clusters in AWS |
|AWS Fargate |Serverless version of ECS/EKS |
|AWS Lambda  | Serverless - Do NOT worry about servers|
|AWS Batch |Manage batch jobs (AWS Fargate, Amazon EC2 & Spot Instances) |
|Elastic Load Balancer| It has different types as below:|
|Application Load Balancer (ALB) |Supports content-based routing  (path- or host-based routing), Works at the application layer. Best suited for microservices and containerized applications. Lambadas, EC2, web app using IP, ECS |
|Network Load Balancer (NLB) | Designed for ultra-low latency and high-performance requirements. Operates at the transport layer. Provides static IP addresses and elastic IP support.Ideal for handling large volumes of TCP/UDP requests or workloads requiring extreme performance.|
|Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) |Works at Layer 3 and serves as a bump-in-the-wire for network traffic. Designed to route traffic through network security appliances like firewalls. Ideal for deploying and managing third-party virtual appliances. |
|Amazon RDS |Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL (InnoDB storage engine full supported), MariaDB
(Enhanced MySQL), Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server. |
|Amazon Aurora | MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible, Provides "Global Database" option|
